## Description
This project lets people reference my work as a student (at the moment).  Later it will contain all my projects.In the future I will include a link as a reference.

## Code Sections
The navigation includes short-cuts to the About, Project descriptions and how to contact me.

The body of the document goes into detail about the three navigation headings.

I include a section about a Current Project and Future Work, which describes the type of work I plan to do after graduating from Boot Camp.

## Lessons Learned
I started with a lot of unnecessary html and css language.  I work diligently to figure out where I could streamline statements and make the project visually appealing.  A lot more work to do, but I like where I ended up for my first try.

I also learned to make a list of the people/sources you wish to acknowledge as you choose to use their work so you don't have to scroll through a bunch of images again to find the ones used.

## Support
I google just about every issue I have or need to revisit or even learn about.  One of my favorite sources is W3Schools.  I like how they show the code and you can try it out.  Check it out:  (https://www.w3schools.com/)

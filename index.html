            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I was born in Medellin, Colombia and then adopted by a family from the United States. <p>My pride and joy is my family.  I love hiking and traveling with my husband. </p>
            <p>I have worked in the real estate field since 2006.  I am a broker and have my own real estate company. </p>   
            <p>I am taking the Coding Boot Camp to push myself in a way I have not before.  Programming does not come easy as I'm very much a right-brain person, but my "why" keeps me going. </p>

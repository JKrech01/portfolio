            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I was born in Medellin, Colombia and then adopted by a family from the United States.My pride and joy is my family.  I love hiking and traveling with my husband.
                
            I have worked in the real estate field since 2006.  I am a broker and have my own real estate company.
            
            I am taking the Coding Boot Camp to push myself in a way I have not before.  Programming does not come easy as I'm very much a right-brain person, but my "why" keeps me going.
